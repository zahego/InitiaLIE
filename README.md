## InitiaLIE
A lie detector prototype app made with Adobe XD for the Mobile Prototype course at Temple University

## Motivation
Lie detector is a sham in a crock. Even the creator on the lie detector themselves say so. However, it makes for a great prank. I remembered back in 2006 when Ipod touch is still a new concept, I had a prank lie detector app on my Ipod touch that I go around and fool my friend with it. Great times.

## Challenges and resolutions
- Since this is a prototype and Adobe XD doesn't have the actual functionalities to deal with the logic like Axure have, I have to literary put in hundereds of pages to make the logic looks like it work seemlessly
- All the wireframe cost me 3-4 days full to complete it. There are thousands of connection from here to there.
